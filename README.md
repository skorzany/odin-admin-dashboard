# odin-admin-dashboard

An admin dashboard for an imaginary service.</br>
Here is the image with the desired design: **[design.png](./design.png)**.<br>

You can view my work on **[GitHub Pages](https://skorzany.github.io/odin-admin-dashboard/)**.


## Additional notes
- The page is **not responsive**, and was designed for full screen desktop view.<br>
If any vertical/horizontal scrollbars appear, hiding any additional browser bars (like bookmarks etc.) <br>will help,

- Because the only thing provided was the design image, the final result is not a pixel-perfect <br>copy of the design, but I tried my best to make it look as close as possible to the original,

- This project uses css grid **excessively**, and that is <em>on purpose</em>.<br>
I understand that some of this stuff could be easily done using <em>flexbox</em>, but the main purpose <br>
of this exercise was to get familiar with <em>CSS grid</em>: positioning items, nesting grids etc.,
